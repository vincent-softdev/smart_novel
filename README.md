# smart_novel

This project aims to make a meaningful contribution to the world of novels.

Today, AI is everywhereâ€”from advanced applications like coding and robotics to everyday activities such as searching online and watching movies. However, there is a lack of AI technology in the novel industry. This project will serve as a starting point to change that.

While some novel websites may already be implementing AI, I am committed to doing my best to bring AI technology to enrich our novel culture.
